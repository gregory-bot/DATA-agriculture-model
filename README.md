# Agricultural AI System - Production Ready

## 🌾 Real AI-Powered Crop Analysis

This application uses **real agricultural AI APIs** to provide accurate crop disease detection and yield estimation.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Option 1: Roboflow API (Recommended)
1. Sign up at [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)
2. Search for "crop disease detection" or "agricultural AI" models
3. Get your API key from your Roboflow dashboard
4. Update `src/services/aiModel.ts` with your API key:
   ```typescript
   private apiKey = 'YOUR_ROBOFLOW_API_KEY';
   ```

### Option 2: Plant.id API
1. Sign up at [Plant.id](https://plant.id/)
2. Get your API key
3. Use their plant disease identification API

### Option 3: Custom Agricultural AI APIs
- **AgriVision API**: Specialized in crop disease detection
- **CropScope API**: Multi-crop analysis platform
- **FarmAI API**: Comprehensive agricultural intelligence

## 🔧 API Integration Steps

1. **Get API Credentials**
   ```bash
   # Sign up for any agricultural AI service
   # Get your API key and endpoint URL
   ```

2. **Update Configuration**
   ```typescript
   // In src/services/aiModel.ts
   private apiKey = 'your-api-key-here';
   private modelEndpoint = 'https://api.your-service.com/analyze';
   ```

3. **Test the Integration**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Upload a crop image to test the API connection
   ```

## 📊 Supported Features
